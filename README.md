## Connecting the Tool Lock Endstop

Note that the two limit switches must be wired together in series as per page 8 of the assembly instructions 
[PDF](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/assets/f0/56/bb/d9/a8/toolchanger_lock_assembly_instructions_1.pdf).

From here, you will take the toolchanger lock connector and install it in the E0 endstop.
(Note that you cannot use an endstop on E0 with the toolchanger lock.)
